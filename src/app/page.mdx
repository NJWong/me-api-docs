# Overview

ME-API is a RESTful API for the Mass Effect universe. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This API is free and open for use by anyone, **no authentication** is required. It is **consumption-only** i.e. only the `GET` method is allowed on resources.

We provide ME-API **free of charge**, and is intended to be used for small-scale personal projects or as an educational tool. It is rate-limited to **100 requests per minute**, and **1000 requests per day**. If you require a higher rate limit, please get in contact.

## Motivation

When learning new technologies, I like to build something that I'm passionate about. I'm a huge fan of the Mass Effect series, and I wanted to build something that I could use in my own projects. I also wanted to build something that other people could use, and I thought that an API would be a great way to do that.

[SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) are two of my favourite public APIs, and I wanted to build something similar for Mass Effect. I wanted to build something that was easy to use, and that anyone could use in their own projects. I also wanted to build something that was free and open-source, and that anyone could contribute to.

## Usage

Whether you're using JavaScript, Python, or Go, this API is easy to use. Any application that can send HTTP requests can use ME-API. You can use it to build a website, mobile app, desktop app, or even a CLI tool!
